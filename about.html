        Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known
        professionally as Juice Wrld , was an American rapper, singer, and
        songwriter. He was a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap
        genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s.
        His stage name was derived from the film Juice (1992) and he stated it
        represents "taking over the world".

        Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 and signed a
        recording contract with Grade A Productions and Interscope Records in
        2017. He gained recognition with his now diamond-certified 2018 single
        "Lucid Dreams", which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100.
        It was included on his triple platinum debut studio album Goodbye & Good
        Riddance (2018), alongside the singles "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean
        wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on
        the Hot 100. He then collaborated with Future on the mixtape Wrld on
        Drugs (2018), and released his second album, Death Race for Love, in
        2019; it contained the hit single "Robbery" and became Higgins' first
        number one debut on the US Billboard 200.
